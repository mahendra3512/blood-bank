<h3>Why Donate?</h3>
	<h4>I am a Red Cross blood donor that won't give up.  I tried to give blood when I was 18, but was declined in both my junior and senior high school years. Once I got to college, I was deferred again. I was finally able to give blood and have given twice. I love donating blood. The thought of being able to help save three peopleâ€™s lives every time I go makes me feel like a better person.</h4>
